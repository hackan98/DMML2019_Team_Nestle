## World Happiness Report

The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations. The report is a
measurement of life quality in the different countries all around the world.

This happiness measurement is based on different features that correlates with life factors.
The different features of the dataset are Health information, the efficiency of social support,
freedom level, democratic quality and others.

We would like to see what features have the most impact on the happiness score.
